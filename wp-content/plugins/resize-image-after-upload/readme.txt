Automatically resize your images after upload using this plugin. Specify height&width, the plugin will do the rest quickly and transparently.

== Description ==

**A free, fast, easy to use, stable and frequently updated plugin to resize your images after upload. Supported by the friendly team that created <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/" target="_blank">ShortPixel</a>  :)**

This plugin automatically resizes images (JPEG, GIF, and PNG) when they are uploaded to within a given maximum width and/or height to reduce server space usage, speed up your website, save you time and boost your site's SEO. 
Imagine that nowadays images can be over 4-5MB and using this plugin you can reduce them to 100-200KB with no extra effort on your side!

In addition, the plugin can force re-compression of uploaded JPEG images and convert PNGs to JPEG (if they don't have a transparency layer), regardless of whether they are resized or not.

Is that simple, just give it a try, it is safe and free! :-)

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin 'resize-image-after-upload' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Edit the max-width/max-height settings under 'Settings > Resize Image Upload'.
4. Once active, just upload images as normal and it will just work!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is this plugin compressing the images? =
	Yes, this plugin compresses the original images, you can select the JPEG quality for example. For a professional image optimization solution though we recommend you <a rel="friend" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/" target="_blank">this</a> image optimization plugin.

= Is this plugin resizing also older images? =
	This plugin will *not* resize images that have already been uploaded. For this you can use <a rel="friend" href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/shortpixel-image-optimiser/" target="_blank">ShortPixel</a>, it can not only resize your images but it can compressthem as well!

= Is the original image and/or its EXIF data kept? =

= 1.7 =
This is a major under-the-hood release to change core workings of the plugin. The plugin still functions as normal, but the way in which it resizes images has now changed to use standard WordPress libraries. This means that should your server have better image processing libraries than the GD default (e.g. ImageMagick), then the resizing method should make use of them. This should improve the output of your resized images!
